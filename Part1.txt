Try to run the test 'test_adding_meal' in tests.py
The test will not run, what is missing in the code?
Once this issue is fixed, the test will run successfully.

Fix/write/implement the solution in the code BUT ALSO write/narrate/explain your solution below!


Solution:

Basic setup, as there was no assertion in part 1 I just had to make it run after basic setup
