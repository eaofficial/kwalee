Implement the 'add_meal' method in the MealHistory class.
Uncomment the 5 lines of the unit test that are marked for Part2:
  -  self.assertEqual(4, len(meal_history.meal_ids))
  -  self.assertEqual(1, meal_history.vegan_count)
  -  self.assertEqual(2, meal_history.vegetarian_count)
  -  self.assertEqual(2, meal_history.dairy_free_count)
  -  self.assertEqual(3, meal_history.pescatarian_count)

The numbers in the assertions in the unit test are correct, you should not change them.
Instead use those numbers to figure out what the 'add_meal' method is supposed to do.
Once this method is implemented, the unit test (including those uncommented lines) should pass without any errors.

Fix/write/implement the solution in the code BUT ALSO write/narrate/explain your solution below!

Solution:
Had to implement add_meal function
    - append meal_id to list
    - check if meal_id already in history to accommodate duplicate additions
    - for the meal get all ingredients
        for each ingredient check its unsuitable diets and increment instance param in meal history
