Implement the 'get_ingredients_string' method in the Meal class.
The method should return a string of comma-separated, uppercase ingredient object_ids, sorted alphabetically.
Uncomment the 4 lines of the unit test that are marked for Part6:
  -  sausage_roll = db.get_object_by_id(object_id='sausage_roll')
  -  hot_dog = db.get_object_by_id(object_id='hot_dog')
  -  self.assertEqual('BREAD,SAUSAGE', sausage_roll.get_ingredients_string())
  -  self.assertEqual('BREAD,CHEESE,ONION,SAUSAGE', hot_dog.get_ingredients_string())
You should only need to change the method itself, nothing else. (unless you have made a mistake in a previous part)
Once this is done, the unit test (including those uncommented lines) should complete without any errors.

Fix/write/implement the solution in the code BUT ALSO write/narrate/explain your solution below!

Solution:
implemented 'get_ingredients_string' method
for a particular meal id, it gets all ingridients from db then sort them then return them in csv
