This is the setup to the technical test.
You want to run the unit test in tests.py
You will know your environment is setup properly once the test runs without errors,
and you see the three printed statements : 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3

I would recommend installing PyCharm and opening the part_0 folder directly in there.
Then you should be able to right-click the test and run it directly. (see the screenshot in this folder)

Make sure you're running Python 3, not 2!
