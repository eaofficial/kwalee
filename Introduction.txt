This test takes place in 6 parts, one after the other. These parts must be done in order, and can not be skipped.
If you get really stuck on one part, please ask for help.
Of course it's best to do everything without hints or answers, but you're not expected to know everything,
and we have hints for each part if (and only if) you can't solve it alone.

If even with the hint, you cannot solve that specific part, we can provide you with a solution so you can proceed with
the next step, but you will have to send us your current work first.

For example, if you cannot complete Part3, even with the hint, then send us what you have so far,
and we will send you back a test with parts 1 to 3 completed and 4 to 6 still to do.

Run the code! This test is insanely hard if you're only looking at it in a text editor.

Please remember, how you approach the problem is just as important as how you solve the problem, do not forget to write
down any thing you did, or assumptions you made, below the question.
